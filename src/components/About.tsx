            <p>
              Hi, I'm Paulo Rodrigues. I recently graduated from ISEP (Instituto
              Superior de Engenharua do Porto) with a degree in Computer
              Engineering, specializing in Games, Graphics, and Interactive
              Systems. I also have a degree in Web Information Technologies and
              Systems from ESMAD (Escola Superior de Media Arte e Design)
            </p>
            <p>
              I have experience developing games in Unity (C#), web applications
              (HTML, CSS, JS, and React), and creating APIs (Node.js and
              documentation with Swagger). I also have experience prototyping in
              Python, integrating accessibility solutions such as hand-tracking
              and voice control, and knowledge of UI/UX and digital marketing.
